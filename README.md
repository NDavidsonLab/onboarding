# NDavidson Lab Onboarding Repository

The repository is home to the onboarding information for the [NDavidson Lab](https://NDavidsonlab.org/) at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

# Checklist for new lab members
* **Read the [`onboarding.md`](onboarding.md) document**.
It has important information about the lab's mission, expectations, lab meetings, individual meetings, source code, reproducibility, etc.
Ask if you have questions.
* As a member of the lab, you should be able to **claim a GitHub Pro account** for your personal user.
This can provide free access to **GitHub Copilot**.
Check out the [GitHub Global Campus](https://education.github.com/).
* **Request access to the [lab's GitHub organization](https://github.com/NDavidsonlab)**.
For this, we will need your GitHub user.
* **Request access to the [lab's Slack workspace](https://NDavidsonlab.slack.com/)**.
We need your email address to send you an invitation to join.
* **Ensure your computer meets the Baseline Secure Computing Standards**.
You are likely going to work with public, confidential and/or highly confidential data (see [CU Data Classification](https://www.cu.edu/data-governance/resources-support/data-classification)).
Please, make sure your computer meets the [Baseline Secure Computing Standards](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/offices/information-security-and-it-compliance/resources/security-management/baseline-secure-computing-standards), such as activating automatic updates, enabling the firewall, encrypting the whole disk, among many others.
